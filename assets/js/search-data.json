Over the course of days and weeks I have many thoughts, but most of them remain in my head - more unclear than clear. It would be great to reflect on these thoughts, try to write them down and by doing them be forced to think more clearly about them and be able to formulate them concise. . In my field of work (Deep Learning for Computer Vision) I am seeing a lot of different approaches and have opinions I would like to voice and thereby help others. This blog is a way to do that. . Exercising writing things down in English is a skill I can improve in a lot still. I am a German native speaker, but work in a company where everybody talks English. In my work I am noting down too little and do too little documenting of my code, decisions and projects. Feeling more comfortable in writing could help here. . Writing forces you to put something out there, which will make you research the things you are saying a lot more than if you are just arguing with yourself in your own head. The same I observe when I am doing talks, it&#39;s exhausting, but very rewarding after it&#39;s done. . And finally I want to learn from feedback I will get for my writing and ideas. Maybe people reach out to me because of something they read on this blog. The internet is vast and publishing quality content is one of the best ways to increase the number of opportunities that will reach you. It also looks cool on your resume to have a blog. ;) .",

As I am just starting, I will note down some thoughts about why I want to write here and will think about topics I can write about. . Why do I want to write? .

It would be great to reflect on these thoughts, try to write them down and by doing them be forced to think more clearly about them and be able to formulate them concise. . What seems important to succeed in writing? . Writing regularly is one of the most important things to get into the habit and to get better. Daily is too much, every two weeks is too infrequent. I think I should write something weekly. This would amount to 52 posts per year, which would be a great success. . When? I work remotely for an US company, which gives me flexibility in my mornings as nobody is awake yet. Friday mornings would be a great place to reflect on the ideas of the week. . What could I write about? .",
